# OF Intention Repeater (Orgonite France Intention Repeater)
Intention repeater research project inspired by https://github.com/tsweet77

FIRST EXPERIMENTS (7th of January, 2020)

My first tests show the following (with the program running on onlinedgb.com and repl.it) :

With the simplest intention "LOVE", it seems to produce a blue hole in the sky after at least 4 hours of running this program. That still needs to be confirmed. Why ? Because there are orgonite towerbusters that are in the area so I cannot confirm that the program itself has induced the blue hole, or that the towerbusters induced that, or both...

An important test to do is to run this program for 4 hours in a non-gifted area in order to know if it is effective alone.

Anyway, if you have orgonite around, then I think that it works in combination with the orgonite devices (eg. towerbusters). That still needs confirmation !

NEW EXPERIMENTS (8th of January, 2020)

the "OF Intention Repeater.exe" sends the word "LOVE" as an intention (in the Aether/Etheric Realm ?).

I've run the "OF Intention Repeater.exe" file during approximatively 8 hours this last night. On this morning there were a huge blue hole over, with a diameter of approximatively 30 to 40 kilometers. There were orgonite devices around (some towerbusters and a Mini-PW from Orgonise-Africa that was powered by a software frequency generator with 963Hz + 528Hz). I still don't know if the program alone has induced the blue hole, or if it is the program + the orgonite devices around that have induced that.

I've had a feedback from Thomas Sweet (that is the first one that has programmed a software Intention Repeater at https://github.com/tsweet77) and he wrote me that : "I ran your program and can definitely feel it."

I'm very happy that he gave me this feedback. I'll then go on this experiment that I think/feel is more oriented "Information Theory" such as the work done by "Jacques Benveniste" around "The Memory Of Water" (https://books.google.fr/books/about/Ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9_sur_la_M%C3%A9moire_de_l_eau.html?id=oKyz0ggBFpoC&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

If you need to analyze the .exe file https://opentip.kaspersky.com/

Possible options :

--help : Show help.

--intention "THE INTENT" : Set a specific intent

--maxcounter 500 : Set the maximum of repeats (in millions, multiplied by multiplication factor)

--multiplicationfactor : Set the multiplication factor (default is actually 128, better is 256 on my HP EliteBook laptop)

--showcounter : Show live counter (in millions, eg. 1M = 1 million). To be multiplied with the multiplication factor to get real repeats counter.
